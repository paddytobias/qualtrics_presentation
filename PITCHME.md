This course uses a hypothetical research scenario...

---
## SCENARIO:

We are a group of social scientists with a research interest broadly in health and wellbeing.

+++
We...
* first explore the Qualtrics platform to suit our needs |
* run through a separate scenario just to test it out, exploring all the features of the Qualtrics Survey Editor |

---
## SCENARIO UPDATE:

We have decided to go ahead with Qualtrics. With our survey we want to identify the intersections between people's socio-cultural backgrounds, professional activities and their overall health. 

---
We therefore set out to build a *Health and Nutrition survey* which will be delivered to participants 16 years and older to a culturally diverse group of participants. We already have a survey developed on our computer that can be used.

+++
We...
* format our survey and import it into Qualtrics |
* then configure the survey in Qualtrics using a range of design features to improve the experience of our respondents |
* finally, we distribute our survey via a number of channels |

---
## SCENARIO UPDATE:

We have been highly successful in our responses, which we want to integrate with 10,000 responses we have collected elsewhere previously. We want them all in Qualtrics so we can analyse them together...

+++
We...
* learn how to prepare our externally-collected survey data for importing into Qualtrics |
* then use Qualtrics' analysis tools to make sense of our data, applying filters, getting aggregate descriptions, relating responses to separate questions, etc. |
